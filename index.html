                <p>Makoto Niitsu (新津 誠, Niitsu Makoto); born February 9, 1973), known as Makoto Shinkai (新海 誠, Shinkai Makoto), is a
                    Japanese animator, filmmaker, author, and manga artist.</p>
                
                <p>Shinkai began his career as a video game animator with Nihon Falcom in 1996, and gained recognition as a filmmaker
                    with
                    the release of the original video animation (OVA) She and Her Cat (1999). Beginning his longstanding association
                    with
                    CoMix Wave Films, Shinkai then released the science-fiction OVA Voices of a Distant Star in 2002, and followed this
                    with
                    his debut feature film The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004).</p>
                
                <p>Shinkai's second feature film, the romantic drama anthology 5 Centimeters per Second (2007), gained critical acclaim,
                    as
                    did his subsequent releases, the dramas Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011) and The Garden of Words (2013).
                    Shinkai's
                    2016 fantasy romance Your Name was a critical and commercial success, becoming the third highest-grossing anime film
                    of
                    all time. His 2019 film, Weathering with You, also achieved similar critical and commercial success.</p>

                <p>After graduating from Chuo University Faculty of Literature in March 1996, he got a job at Falcom, a video game
                    company where he worked for 5 years making video clips for games and graphic design including web content. During
                    this time he met musician Tenmon, who later scored many of his movies.</p>

            <p class="text">Voices of a Distant Star was followed by the 90-minute The Place Promised in Our Early Days, which was released
                nationwide in Japan on November 20, 2004. It was critically acclaimed, winning many honors. Shinkai's next
                project was 5 Centimeters per Second and premiered 3 March 2007. It consists of three short films: Cherry Blossom,
                Cosmonaut, and 5 Centimeters per Second.[15] The total run time is about 63 minutes. In September 2007 Nagano's
                leading
                newspaper, Shinano Mainichi Shinbun, released a TV commercial animated by Shinkai.</p>

            <p class="text">Shinkai spent 2008 in London, resting since the completion of 5 Centimeters per Second. He returned to Japan in 2009
                to
                start work on his next project. He released two concept drawings for this film in December 2009. Shinkai noted that
                it
                would be his longest animation film to date and described the story as a "lively" animated film with adventure,
                action,
                and romance centered on a cheerful and spirited girl on a journey to say "farewell". In November 2010, he revealed
                that his next work would be titled Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below. A teaser trailer was released on
                November 9, and the film was released on May 7, 2011.</p>
