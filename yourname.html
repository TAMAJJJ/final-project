                    In 2013, Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the rural town of Itomori, Japan. Bored of the town, she
                    wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. One day, she inexplicably begins to switch bodies intermittently with
                    Taki
                    Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo: thus when they wake up as each other on some mornings, they must live through
                    the
                    other's respective activities and social interactions for the day. They learn they can communicate with each other
                    by
                    leaving messages on paper, phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a
                    date
                    with coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) causes Mitsuha to become popular at school. One day, Taki
                    (in
                    Mitsuha's body) accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to leave the ritual alcohol
                    kuchikamizake, made by the sisters, as an offering at the Shinto shrine located on a mountaintop outside the town.
                    It is
                    believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling over human connections and time. Taki reads a note
                    from Mitsuha about the comet Tiamat, expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next
                    day,
                    Taki wakes up in his body and goes on a date with Miki, who tells him she enjoyed the date but also that she can
                    tell he
                    is preoccupied with thoughts of someone else. Taki attempts to call Mitsuha on the phone, but cannot reach her as
                    the
                    body-switching ends.

                <p>
                    Taki, Miki, and their friend Tsukasa travel to Gifu by train on a trip to Hida in search of Mitsuha, though Taki
                    does
                    not know the name of Itomori, relying on his sketches of the surrounding landscape from memory. A restaurant owner
                    in
                    Hida recognizes the town in the sketch, being originally from there. He takes Taki and his friends to the ruins of
                    Itomori, which has been destroyed and where 500 residents were killed when Tiamat unexpectedly fragmented as it
                    passed
                    by Earth three years earlier. Taki observes Mitsuha's messages disappear from his phone and his memories of her
                    begin to
                    gradually fade, realizing the two were also separated by time, as he is in 2016. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the
                    record
                    of fatalities. While Miki and Tsukasa return to Tokyo, Taki journeys to the shrine, hoping to reconnect with Mitsuha
                    and
                    warn her about Tiamat. There, Taki drinks Mitsuha's kuchikamizake then lapses into a vision, where he glimpses
                    Mitsuha's
                    past. He also recalls that he encountered Mitsuha on a train when she came to Tokyo the day before the event to find
                    him, though Taki did not recognize her as the body-switching was yet to occur in his timeframe. Before leaving the
                    train
                    in embarrassment, Mitsuha had handed him her hair ribbon, which he has since worn on his wrist as a good-luck charm.
